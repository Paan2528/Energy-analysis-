# Solar Energy Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Python-based software application for analyzing solar energy
production data. The program processes raw time-series data from solar sensors,
cleans the data, aggregates energy values on a daily basis, and visualizes the
results using line charts.

The main goal of this project is to practice Python programming and basic
software engineering concepts such as modular design and data processing.
